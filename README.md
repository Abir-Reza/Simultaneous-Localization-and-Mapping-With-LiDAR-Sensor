# Definitions:
## Semantic segmentation is an approach detecting, for every pixel, the belonging class.[17] For example, in a figure with many people, all the pixels belonging to persons will have the same class id and the pixels in the background will be classified as background.
## Instance segmentation is an approach that identifies, for every pixel, the specific belonging instance of the object. It detects each distinct object of interest in the image.[18] For example, when each person in a figure is segmented as an individual object.
## Panoptic segmentation combines both semantic and instance segmentation. Like semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation is an approach that identifies, for every pixel, the belonging class. Moreover, like in instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation distinguishes different instances of the same class.[19] [wiki]
